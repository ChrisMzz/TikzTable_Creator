### TikzTable Creator

A Tikzpicture code generator designed to automate tables of signs (and potentially variations if I can get that to work properly). If the device it's used on has access to internet, it proposes further automation by using Wolfram|Alpha API to get information on the roots of the functions it's given, to save the user from having to type those in (typos happen a lot more frequently than I thought at first so that's a lot more helpful than it sounds). The huge downside to it is sloppy code written in Batch and Python, generating Java classes, themselves generating tikzpicture code ready to be inserted into a LaTeX document (assuming tikzpicture has already been imported).

For anyone wondering, this project was only meant to help me train my coding a little and help me save time while taking notes, I only thought of adding on GitHub because I ended up working a whole lot on it and if that work can help someone else that's enough to make me feel like I didn't just waste 50+ hours doing this :')
